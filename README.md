##Functionality:
I think I deserve a 3 because the encryption and decryption are successfully working, and the encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces are successfully working.

##Object Oriented Programming:
I think I deserve a 3 because there are 4 classes, no more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines, no class is longer than 100 lines, and variable and method names clearly communicate purpose.

##Test Driven Development:
I think I deserve a 3 because every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, my git history demonstrates i am writing tests before implementing code, and my SimpleCov test coverage is 97.53%.

##Version Control:
I think I deserve a 3 because i have well over 30 commits, over 10 pull requests, and my commits don't include multiple pieces of functionality.
